# Spec: Metric Defect Remediation (post-audit review)

**Created:** 2026-08-13
**Author:** Ryan Brew
**Status:** Open — no fixes applied yet
**Supersedes nothing.** This is a follow-up to `specs/artefact-fixes.md` (the
2026-05-07 audit). That audit fixed A1–A5 in `by_model.csv`, `summary.json`
and `docs/FINDINGS.md` — but did **not** propagate the corrections to the
model-family aggregation or to hypothesis tests H3 and H4, and introduced no
chance-corrected baseline for direction accuracy.

**Amended 2026-08-13 (same day), after a full file-by-file read of the repo.**
D9–D11 were added. D9 supersedes part of D7: the T2 engine question is not
merely ambiguous, the *T1* ground-truth engine is also misstated, and the
Stockfish depth published everywhere is not the depth that ran. D10 upgrades
the A6/D6 rescue disclosure from a caveat to a P0, and identifies a route to
the single-shot legality number that D6 assumed was unrecoverable.

---

## Goal

Close eleven defects that would undermine the benchmark if published as-is.

**None of these require re-running LLM inference, Stockfish, or Lc0.** All are
postprocessing over the existing `results/evaluations.jsonl` (526,662 records),
documentation corrections, or file housekeeping — exactly like the May audit.
This is true of D9–D11 as well: D9 is prose plus a provenance block, D10 is a
read-only partition of records already on disk, D11 is deleting a stale file.
If D10 step 4 lands with adequate coverage, it *removes* the only item in this
register that would have needed GPU time (D6 step 3).

**What is not in question:** every headline number in `docs/FINDINGS.md`
reconciles against `results/metrics/by_model.csv` to within rounding. This was
re-verified on 2026-08-13 across all eight headline figures (legality 97.847
vs 97.85 claimed; clamped CPL 701.6 vs 702; direction t0/t50/t100/t200 =
44.18/46.19/61.75/79.06 vs 44.5/46.1/61.6/78.9; wp_loss 310.7 vs 311; T3 v2
0.519 vs 0.520). The retry experiment reconciles exactly (10,665 records,
7,212 legal = 67.6%). The defects below are about **metric construction and
stale propagation**, not arithmetic errors.

**What D9 and D10 add to that statement:** the arithmetic still holds, but
(a) the *provenance* attached to those numbers in the docs is wrong — they are
not Stockfish-at-depth-22 numbers (D9), and (b) the legality figure pools two
different measurement procedures, so it is arithmetically correct but
semantically undefined (D10). Reconciling a number against a CSV does not
establish that the number measures what the prose says it measures.

### D1 — Direction accuracy is compared against an invalid baseline (P0)

**Status:** Root cause verified in code. Magnitude needs raw data to confirm.

`docs/FINDINGS.md` Finding 3 reports direction accuracy against a stated
**"Random baseline (3-class) = 33%"** at every threshold. That baseline is only
valid when the three classes are balanced. They are not.

`_compute_direction_correct` (`src/metrics.py:258-271`) applies the *same*
threshold to both the model eval and the Stockfish eval:

```python
me_dir = np.where(model_eval > threshold, "W",
                   np.where(model_eval < -threshold, "B", "E"))
sf_dir = np.where(stockfish_eval > threshold, "W",
                   np.where(stockfish_eval < -threshold, "B", "E"))
correct = (me_dir == sf_dir)
```

As `threshold → ∞`, both sides collapse to `"E"` for every record and accuracy
converges to **100% by construction**, independent of model skill. So the
reported climb 44.5% → 46.1% → 61.6% → 78.9% is partly a mechanical artefact of
raising the threshold, not evidence of improving model judgment.

This matters concretely because the ground truth is heavily imbalanced. Our own
methodology section states **92% of Stockfish ground-truth evals lie within
±300 cp**. If the ±200 "equal" class holds ~80% of positions, then a degenerate
model answering `"E"` unconditionally scores ~80% — **above** the 78.9%
all-model average currently presented as a positive result.

**Why it matters:** Finding 3's strongest claim ("at a 2-pawn threshold, models
agree with Stockfish 79% of the time") could invert to "models fail to beat the
majority-class baseline." This is the first thing a reviewer will test.

**Fix**
1. Compute the ground-truth class prior at each threshold in
   `DIRECTION_THRESHOLDS_CP` and emit `direction_baselines.csv` with columns
   `threshold, pct_W, pct_B, pct_E, majority_class, majority_baseline_acc`.
2. Report **Cohen's κ** and **balanced accuracy** per (model, threshold)
   alongside raw accuracy. κ corrects for chance agreement given the actual
   marginals; raw accuracy does not.
3. Replace the "Random baseline 33%" column in Finding 3 with the
   majority-class baseline per threshold.
4. If κ ≤ 0 at ±200, say so explicitly and rewrite Finding 3's conclusion.

**Verification**
- `test_direction_baseline_matches_priors` — synthetic df, known class split,
  assert `majority_baseline_acc` equals the majority prior.
- `test_degenerate_predictor_scores_baseline` — a model emitting constant 0 cp
  must score ≈ the majority baseline and **κ ≈ 0** at every threshold.
- `test_kappa_zero_for_random_predictor` — shuffled predictions give κ ≈ 0.

### D2 — Direction accuracy is non-monotonic and reverses model ranking (P0)

**Status:** Verified from `by_model.csv`.

Same root cause as D1, different symptom. Per-model accuracy across thresholds:

| model | t0 | t50 | t100 | t200 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gemma3:4b | **10.4** | 52.2 | 75.8 | 91.0 |
| llama3.3:70b | 58.2 | 34.3 | **21.9** | 42.2 |
| gemma4:31b | 52.2 | 38.8 | **31.8** | 61.7 |
| qwen2.5:14b | 58.2 | 47.6 | 66.5 | 80.0 |
| deepseek-r1:14b | 41.8 | 53.0 | 76.7 | 91.8 |

gemma3:4b swings 7× (10.4% → 75.8%) on identical underlying predictions.
llama3.3:70b and gemma4:31b both dip below the 33% figure and then *recover* at
±200 — non-monotonic, which a well-posed accuracy metric should not be. The
metric is measuring the interaction between each model's **output scale** and
the threshold, not its ability to identify the stronger side.

Consequence: Finding 3's headline claims — "llama3.3:70b is systematically
wrong", "the largest model in the study is anti-correlated with truth", and the
whole "play vs reason decoupling" narrative — are **threshold-contingent**. At
t0, llama3.3:70b (58.2%) *outranks* deepseek-r1:14b (41.8%), the exact reverse
of the reported ranking.

**Competing explanation that must be ruled out first:** a sign or
perspective bug. If a model reports evaluations from the side-to-move's
perspective rather than White's, its sign inverts on every Black-to-move
position (~50% of records) and produces exactly this signature. The two models
that dip below random (llama3.3:70b, gemma4:31b) are the prime suspects.
"70B models are anti-correlated with chess truth" is an extraordinary claim; a
parser bug is the ordinary one, and it must be eliminated before publication.

**Fix**
1. Split direction accuracy by side-to-move (`_white_to_move_from_fen` already
   exists at `src/metrics.py:61`). If llama3.3:70b's accuracy is high on
   white-to-move and inverted on black-to-move, it is a perspective bug — fix
   the parser in `src/evaluator.py` and recompute. This is the decisive test.
2. Sample 50 raw llama3.3:70b and gemma4:31b eval responses and hand-check the
   parsed sign against the model's own words.
3. Report a scale-free rank measure (Spearman ρ between model eval and
   Stockfish eval per model) that does not depend on any threshold. Lead with
   this; keep the threshold table as a secondary robustness view.

**Verification**
- `test_direction_split_by_side_to_move` — synthetic perspective-inverted
  model scores high on white-to-move, near-zero on black-to-move.
- `test_spearman_rho_threshold_free` — ρ is unchanged when all evals are
  scaled by a positive constant (thresholded accuracy is not).

### D3 — Model family/size parsing merges distinct models (P0, live bug)

**Status:** Verified exactly. Arithmetic below is exact, not approximate.

`parse_model_info` (`src/utils.py:140-186`) has two independent faults.

**Fault A — incomplete family map.** Only five prefixes are recognised:

```python
family_map = {"qwen": "qwen", "llama": "llama", "mistral": "mistral",
              "phi": "phi", "gemma": "gemma"}
```

Missing: `deepseek`, `mixtral`, `solar`, `codellama`, `yi`, `command-r`,
`wizardlm`. **8 of 22 models fall into family `"unknown"`.**

**Fault B — size parser fails on non-integer tags.**

```python
size_clean = size_str.lower().replace("b", "")   # "e2b" -> "e2", "8x7b" -> "8x7"
try: size_b = int(size_clean)
except ValueError:
    try: size_b = float(size_clean)
    except ValueError: pass                       # size_b stays 0
```

`e2b`, `e4b`, and `8x7b` all silently parse to **0.0 billion parameters**.

`aggregate_by_model_family` (`src/metrics.py:454`) then groups by
`["model_family", "model_size_b"]`, so any two models colliding on that pair
are **averaged into one row**. Since no single model exceeds 24,000 records,
any row above that is a merge. Three rows are:

| row in `by_model_family.csv` | n | actually contains |
|---|---|---|
| `gemma`, size `0.0` | 47,962 | gemma4:e2b (23,963) + gemma4:e4b (23,999) |
| `unknown`, size `7.0` | 46,935 | deepseek-r1:7b (22,970) + wizardlm2:7b (23,965) |
| `unknown`, size `34.0` | 47,982 | codellama:34b (24,000) + yi:34b (23,982) |

All three sums are exact. `mixtral:8x7b` also lands at `unknown/0.0`.

**Why it matters:** CodeLlama and Yi averaged together is not a family, and
**H4 ("larger models perform better within family") is computed over these
mislabelled groups** — see `src/metrics.py:677-682`. Any scaling claim derived
from this table is unsound.

**Fix**
1. Extend `family_map` to cover all 22 tags. Note ordering: check `codellama`
   before `llama` if prefix matching is kept, or switch to explicit exact-tag
   lookup (preferred — it fails loudly on an unknown tag).
2. Parse sizes with a regex that handles `e2b`/`e4b` (Gemma "effective"
   variants) and `8x7b` (MoE). Record MoE models with both total and active
   parameter counts; they are not comparable to dense models on a single axis
   and should be excluded from scaling regressions.
3. **Raise on `family == "unknown"` or `size_b == 0`** rather than silently
   bucketing. A silent 0.0 is what caused this.
4. Add an assertion in `aggregate_by_model_family` that each output row's
   `job_id` count is ≤ the max per-model count, and that group count equals the
   distinct model count.

**Verification**
- `test_parse_model_info_all_configured_tags` — every tag in `config.yaml`
  yields a non-`unknown` family and non-zero size.
- `test_parse_model_info_effective_and_moe_tags` — `gemma4:e2b`→2,
  `gemma4:e4b`→4, `mixtral:8x7b`→(56 total / 12.9 active) or explicit MoE flag.
- `test_codellama_not_matched_as_llama` — regression guard on prefix ordering.
- `test_family_rows_are_one_model_each` — no output row exceeds max per-model
  record count.
- `test_unknown_family_raises` — unrecognised tag raises, not defaults.

### D4 — H3, H4 and the family table still use pre-audit metrics (P1)

**Status:** Verified in code and in `summary.json`.

The May audit added corrected columns (`t2_cpl_clamped`, `t2_wp_loss`,
`t3_score_v2`, `t1_abs_error_excl_mate`, `t2_legal_attempted`,
`t1_direction_correct_t{0,50,100,200}`) and wired them into H1 and H2 via the
`primary_metric` / `metrics` pattern. **H3, H4 and
`aggregate_by_model_family` were missed.**

| site | code | uses | should use |
|---|---|---|---|
| H3 | `metrics.py:661` | `t3_score` | `t3_score_v2` |
| H4 | `metrics.py:682` | `t1_absolute_error`, `t2_cpl`, `t3_score` | `t1_abs_error_excl_mate`, `t2_cpl_clamped`, `t3_score_v2` |
| family agg | `metrics.py:454` | `t1_absolute_error`, `t2_cpl`, `t2_legal`, `t3_score` | corrected equivalents |

Confirmation from the shipped artefacts: H3's values in `summary.json`
(`easy 0.4176, medium 0.4342, hard 0.4029, extreme 0.3809`) match the **v1**
`t3_score` column in `by_difficulty.csv` — the matcher documented in A3 as
missing 70% of theme classes. And `by_model_family.csv`'s `t2_legal` column
sits at ~0.66, i.e. it is still the **A4 buggy legality denominator** that the
audit replaced with 97.85%.

So the repo simultaneously publishes 97.85% legality in `by_model.csv` and
64.6%-flavoured legality in `by_model_family.csv`. That internal contradiction
is trivially discoverable.

**Fix:** apply the H1/H2 `primary_metric`/`metrics` pattern to H3 and H4;
add corrected columns to the family aggregation; keep the legacy columns
alongside for transparency, suffixed `_legacy`.

**Verification**
- `test_h3_uses_v2_theme_score` — H3 reports `primary_metric == "t3_score_v2"`.
- `test_h4_uses_corrected_metrics` — H4 reports clamped CPL, not `t2_cpl`.
- `test_family_table_has_corrected_columns` — asserts presence of all five
  corrected columns.
- `test_no_buggy_legality_in_published_csvs` — no shipped CSV carries a
  legality column whose all-model mean is < 0.90.

---

### D5 — Clamped CPL is saturated; model ranking rests on ~2% of scale (P1)

**Status:** Verified from `by_model.csv`.

Per-model **median** clamped CPL runs **901–980** against a clamp of 1000.
More than half of all legal moves sit within 5–10% of the ceiling. Cross-model
standard deviation is **22.5 on a 0–1000 scale**.

The headline "gemma4:31b best at 634, gemma4:e2b worst at 727" is a 93-point
gap on a metric that is pinned near its cap, with 39.1% of moves exactly at it.
Mechanically, `mean_clamped_cpl ≈ 1000 × P(blunder) + (small residual)` — the
metric is a **blunder-rate proxy in centipawn clothing**, and presenting it as
a continuous quality score overstates its resolution.

**Fix**
1. Report **blunder rate** (`P(CPL ≥ 1000)`) as the primary T2 quality metric —
   it is what the number actually encodes, and it is directly interpretable.
2. Attach bootstrap 95% CIs to every per-model T2 figure. With ~24k records per
   model the CIs will be tight, but the point is to show the reader that a
   634-vs-727 gap on a saturated metric is a weak ordering.
3. Emit `cpl_buckets.csv` with the five buckets already in Finding 2, per model,
   with counts — so readers can see the bimodality directly rather than
   inferring it from a mean.
4. Keep median alongside mean everywhere; a mean of 702 against a median of
   ~950 is itself informative and currently unreported per-model.

**Verification**
- `test_blunder_rate_matches_bucket_counts` — blunder rate equals the
  `CPL ≥ 1000` bucket fraction.
- `test_cpl_ci_overlap_flagged` — models with overlapping 95% CIs are marked
  `rank_tied = True`.

---

### D6 — Legality headline measures the harness, not the model (P1)

**Status:** Known (A6), under-weighted in the writeup.

Finding 1 leads with **97.85% legality**. Per A6 this is *post-rescue*: on
`cot`/`fen_only`/`pgn+fen`, `src/worker.py:208-222` silently (a) scans the
response for any other legal SAN/UCI token, then (b) re-prompts with the full
legal-move list. And `move_only` supplies the legal-move list up front. The
single-shot rate is unrecoverable from stored data.

Publishing "models produce a legal move 98% of the time" as the lead finding
invites exactly one question — *what was the first-attempt rate?* — which
currently has no answer. The supporting evidence points the other way: on the
10,665 records where the rescue still failed, an explicit re-prompt with the
answer set fixed only **67.6%**.

**Fix**
1. Relabel throughout as **"harness-assisted legality (≤2 attempts)"**. Never
   present the bare 98% without that qualifier.
2. Instrument `src/worker.py` to record `t2_move_attempt_1`,
   `t2_legal_attempt_1`, and `t2_rescue_path` for future runs.
3. Re-run a **single-shot legality probe** on a stratified subsample
   (suggest 200 positions × 22 models × 3 combined formats ≈ 13,200 calls,
   a few GPU-hours) with rescue disabled. That yields a defensible
   single-shot number without re-running the full 526k benchmark.
4. Demote legality from Finding 1. Lead with the bimodal CPL result — it is
   the genuine contribution and the finding least affected by D1–D6.

**Verification**
- `test_worker_records_first_attempt` — rescue path populates attempt-1 fields.
- `test_rescue_disabled_flag` — `rescue_enabled=False` returns the raw first
  parse unmodified.

### D7 — T2 ground-truth engine is ambiguous and weak (P2, document)

`docs/FINDINGS.md` states T2 best-move/CPL truth is **Lc0 @ 800 nodes**, but
`results/evaluations_retried.jsonl` names its field `stockfish_best_move`, and
`retried_cpl` is null in all 10,665 records. The artefacts disagree with the
documentation about which engine produced T2 truth.

800 nodes is also a weak reference — and we already report that the two engines
disagree on the best move on **~67%** of the overlap.

**Fix:** rename the field to its actual source; state node/depth settings and
engine versions in `summary.json` provenance (see D8); soften "ground truth" to
"reference engine" for T2; add a sensitivity check re-scoring a 1,000-position
subsample at higher Lc0 node counts to show the ranking is stable.

---

### D8 — Doc/data drift and missing provenance (P2)

| item | doc | data |
|---|---|---|
| raw uncapped mean CPL | 4,786 (`FINDINGS.md`) | 4,735.0 (`summary.json`) |
| all-model legality | 97.85% | 97.88% |
| direction t50 | — | `summary.json` carries **two** values: `t1_direction_accuracy_t50 = 0.46262` and `by_threshold["t50"] = 0.46135` |

Also: `summary.json` has no `generated_at`, git SHA, config snapshot, or engine
versions. The only committed run logs are March **pilot** runs (50 and 5
positions per tier, 2 models, one at depth 15 not 22) — there is no run log for
the actual 526k run, so its date is only recoverable from commit archaeology.

**Fix:** single source of truth for each number (docs generated from
`summary.json`, never hand-typed); reconcile the duplicate t50; stamp
`generated_at`, git SHA, engine versions and config snapshot into
`summary.json` in `scripts/generate_plots.py`.

> **See D9.** The depth-15 pilot log noted above is not an outlier — depth 15
> is the only depth ever committed. D9 supersedes this bullet's framing.

---

### D9 — Ground-truth engine and search depth are misstated in every document (P0)

**Status:** Confirmed by the author, 2026-08-13. Lc0 was chosen **deliberately**
— this machine's GPU is far stronger than its CPU, so a GPU-resident
neural-net engine buys much more search per wall-clock second than CPU
Stockfish. That decision is sound and is not in question. The defect is that
**no document says so**, and several state the opposite.

Every shipped document claims T1 ground truth is **"Stockfish 17 @ depth 22"**.
Both halves of that claim appear to be wrong.

**Evidence — depth.** `config/config.yaml:5` reads
`depth: 15  # Reduced from 22 for ~4x speedup`, and
`git log -S'depth: 15' -- config/config.yaml` places that line in the **initial
commit** (`73c74e0`, 2026-03-17). No committed config has ever specified depth
22. The only artefact showing depth 22 is `results/logs/run_20260316_132053.json`
— a 2-model, 50-position-per-tier pilot that predates the repo's first commit.
The second pilot log (2026-03-17) already shows depth 15.

**Evidence — engine.** Four independent signals point to Lc0, not Stockfish,
as the source of `stockfish_eval`:

1. `scripts/precompute_lc0_batch_v2.py:192-193` writes Lc0 ONNX WDL-derived
   centipawns into the field literally named `stockfish_eval`, and sets
   `stockfish_best_move = None`.
2. All **10,665** rows of `results/evaluations_retried.jsonl` carry
   `stockfish_best_move: null`. That field is read by
   `retry_illegal_moves.py` from the source record's `t2_best_move`, which
   `worker.py` populates from the dataset's `stockfish_best_move`. A Stockfish
   precompute writes a SAN string; an explicit `null` is the signature of
   `precompute_lc0_batch_v2.py`.
3. The A2 mate-truth error table (mean 9,966 / median 9,999) is consistent with
   truth pinned at **exactly ±10,000** — the saturation constant in
   `wdl_to_centipawns()` — and not with Stockfish's variable
   `10000 − mate_in × 10`, which would spread those values out.
4. The **"±16,000 cp"** figure quoted in A1 and A2 is not producible by either
   encoding. Both cap at ±10,000. It appears to be simply an error, and it has
   been repeated as fact through two audit passes.

**Why it matters.** `docs/FINDINGS.md` builds a whole "Two engines" bullet on
the T1-Stockfish / T2-Lc0 distinction, including *"the two engines disagree on
the best move on ~67% of positions."* If T1 truth is also Lc0, that bullet
describes a comparison that never took place, and the headline framing of the
benchmark misidentifies its own instrument. This is the first thing a judge
with engine knowledge will probe.

**Fix — documentation and provenance only. No code change, no data rewrite.**

1. **Verify first, before editing a single document.** On the Linux PC:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('data/easy.json')); \
     print({k: d[0].get(k) for k in ('stockfish_eval','stockfish_best_move')})"
   grep -o '"stockfish_best_move": null' data/*.json | wc -l
   python3 -c "import json; \
     m=max(abs(p['stockfish_eval']) for t in ('easy','medium','hard','extreme') \
     for p in json.load(open(f'data/{t}.json')) if p.get('stockfish_eval') is not None); \
     print('max |truth| =', m)"
   ```
   A null `stockfish_best_move` confirms the Lc0 path. The third command
   settles the ±16,000 question outright.
2. **Do not rename the stored fields.** `stockfish_eval`, `t1_stockfish_eval`
   and `stockfish_best_move` are read by `evaluator.py`, `worker.py`,
   `metrics.py`, `result_writer.py`, `dashboard/server.py`,
   `retry_illegal_moves.py` and `validate_responses.py`. Renaming them means
   rewriting the 526k-record primary data file and touching seven modules for
   zero analytic gain, on the eve of a submission. Record them as **legacy
   names with documented contents** instead. Revisit only if there is time to
   spare after everything else is green.
3. Add a `provenance` block to `summary.json` (in `metrics.save_metrics`, which
   already writes that file). This also closes the D8 provenance gap:
   ```json
   "provenance": {
     "generated_at": "<iso8601>",
     "git_sha": "<rev-parse HEAD>",
     "t1_truth_engine": "lc0-onnx (WDL->cp, saturates ±10000)",
     "t2_truth_engine": "lc0 @ 800 nodes (enrich_cpl.py)",
     "stockfish_depth_config": 15,
     "stockfish_used_for": "none in the shipped 526k run — see D9",
     "legacy_field_note": "fields named stockfish_* hold Lc0 values",
     "config_snapshot": { }
   }
   ```
4. Correct the engine and depth claims in **all five** documents: `README.md`,
   `docs/FINDINGS.md`, `docs/SIMPLE_SUMMARY.md`, `specs/benchmark.md`,
   `specs/benchmark-detailed.md`. State the real engine, the real budget, and
   **the reason** — GPU throughput — which is a defensible methodological
   choice and reads far better than a silent inconsistency.
5. Rewrite the "Two engines" bullet in FINDINGS' methodology section. Either
   drop the 67%-disagreement claim or re-derive it honestly, depending on
   step 1.
6. Correct the "±16,000 cp" figures in A1/A2 to the measured maximum from
   step 1.

**Verification**
- `test_summary_has_provenance` — `summary.json` carries a `provenance` block
  with non-null engine fields and a git SHA.
- `test_no_stale_engine_claims_in_docs` — no shipped `.md` contains the strings
  `"depth 22"` or `"Stockfish 17"`.

### D10 — The 526k records span two worker versions; legality is not uniformly defined (P0)

**Status:** Verified from git history and from the shipped retry file.

The silent illegal-move rescue at `src/worker.py:208-223` **was not present for
the whole collection run.**
`git log -S'extract_move_from_text' -- src/worker.py` returns exactly one
commit: `1e799bb`, 2026-04-09, *"chore: catch up two weeks of code changes"*.
Collection ran from roughly 2026-03-18 to the 2026-04-28 metrics refresh. So an
unknown fraction of the 526,662 records was collected with **no rescue at all**.

A6 and D6 both describe legality as "post-rescue" for every combined-prompt
record. That is only true after the cutover. Before it, `t2_legal` is a raw
single-attempt result.

**Why this is P0 rather than a footnote.** The reported 97.85% is an average
over two different measurement procedures. It is therefore neither a
single-shot rate nor a harness-assisted rate, and answers no well-posed
question. Because the commit is a *catch-up* commit covering two weeks of work,
the git date is only an upper bound on when the code went live — so the
boundary cannot be taken from git alone.

**The boundary is recoverable from the data itself.** Under the post-rescue
code path, `parsed["move"]` is only ever assigned from
`extract_move_from_text()`, which returns a legal SAN move or `None`. A stored
`t2_move` that is **non-null and illegal is therefore impossible after the
cutover.** Records matching `(t2_move.notna() & t2_legal == False)` are
necessarily pre-rescue.

At least **7,366** such records already exist in a committed file:
`results/evaluations_retried.jsonl` has 10,665 rows, of which 3,299 have
`original_move: null`, leaving 7,366 with a stored illegal move.

**Fix — all post-processing over data already on disk. No inference.**

1. Classify each record. Mark `regime = "pre_rescue"` where
   `t2_move.notna() & (t2_legal == False)`. Take the **maximum `timestamp`**
   over those confirmed records as the empirical cutover, then classify every
   record by timestamp against it. Cross-check the derived boundary against
   2026-04-09; report both.
2. Emit `results/metrics/regime_split.csv`:
   `regime, model, prompt_format, n, legality` — so the split is inspectable
   per model rather than asserted in prose.
3. Report legality **separately per regime**. Do not present a pooled 97.85%
   again in any document.
4. **Only if** the pre-rescue cohort is large enough and covers enough of the
   22 models, report its legality as the genuine **single-shot** rate. Gate
   this explicitly: publish per-model `n` alongside every figure, and report
   no single-shot number for any model whose pre-rescue cohort falls below a
   stated minimum (suggest **1,000** records). Where coverage fails, say so —
   do not extrapolate across models.
5. If step 4 succeeds with adequate coverage, **D6 step 3 is superseded** —
   the 13,200-call single-shot probe becomes unnecessary and should be struck.
   If coverage is partial, D6 step 3 survives but is rescoped to only the
   models lacking a usable pre-rescue cohort, which will be far cheaper than
   13,200 calls.
6. Document the second consequence of the cutover: `t2_move is None` means
   *"the parser found no move"* pre-rescue and *"both rescue attempts failed"*
   post-rescue. Two different events sharing one encoding, and
   `t2_legal_attempted` silently drops both.
7. Resolve the `move_only` inconsistency this exposes. Under current code
   `move_only` stores `extract_move_from_text()` output, so its legality is
   **100% by construction** post-cutover — yet FINDINGS Finding 1 caveat 2
   quotes 96.5%. That figure can only come from pre-cutover records or from the
   buggy pooled `t2_legal` column. Determine which and correct it.

**Verification**
- `test_pre_rescue_detection` — synthetic df: a record with a non-null illegal
  move classifies as `pre_rescue`; a legal-or-`None` record is not
  force-classified either way.
- `test_regime_split_partitions_all_records` — regime counts sum to `len(df)`;
  no record silently uncounted.
- `test_no_pooled_legality_in_summary` — `summary.json` exposes legality keyed
  by regime, not as a single pooled scalar.

---

### D11 — `learning_deltas.csv` contradicts the "no correction data" claim (P1)

**Status:** Verified. The file is committed and dates to the initial commit.

`results/metrics/learning_deltas.csv` is in the repo with **24 rows**, all
`qwen2.5:7b`, carrying populated `cpl_correction` and `cpl_control` values and
job IDs in the pre-hash sequential format
(`job_00002_qwen2_5_7b_pgn+fen_1`). It is a March pilot artefact.

Meanwhile `src/feedback_loop.py`'s module docstring, `docs/FINDINGS.md` and
`specs/benchmark.md` all state that **zero** records have
`job_type='correction'` and that no correction-loop data exists.

**Root cause of the survival.** `metrics.save_metrics()` writes that CSV only
`if not learning_df.empty` (`src/metrics.py:863-865`). With the real data the
frame *is* empty, so the write is skipped and the March file is left untouched
on disk — through every regeneration since.

A reviewer who opens `results/metrics/` finds correction-loop data sitting
directly beside the sentence saying none exists.

**Fix**

1. Delete `results/metrics/learning_deltas.csv`.
2. Make the skip explicit rather than silent: in `save_metrics()`, when
   `learning_df` is empty, **remove** any existing `learning_deltas.csv`
   instead of leaving a stale one. Audit `save_metrics()` for any other
   conditionally-written artefact with the same hazard.
3. Resolve the tracking inconsistency this exposes: `results/metrics/` and
   `results/evaluations_retried.jsonl` are listed in `.gitignore` but are
   **tracked in git** (ignore rules do not apply to already-added files). Decide
   deliberately whether these are committed artefacts or generated output, then
   make `.gitignore` and the index agree.

**Verification**
- `test_empty_learning_deltas_removes_stale_file` — write a stale CSV, call
  `save_metrics()` with a correction-free df, assert the file is gone.

## Steps / Logic

Ordered. D1–D3 and D9–D10 gate publication; do them first.

Everything below is postprocessing, documentation, or housekeeping. **No step
requires re-running the benchmark.** Do not re-collect data for any of it.

0. **D9 verification first — 5 minutes, and it changes what every other step
   says.** Run the three commands in D9 step 1. Until you know which engine
   produced `stockfish_eval` and what the true max |truth| is, you cannot write
   a correct methodology section, and D7's "two engines" claim is unresolved.
   Do this before touching any document.
1. **D3** — live code bug, cheapest fix. Correct `parse_model_info`, add the
   guard assertions, regenerate `by_model_family.csv`. ~1 hour.
   ⚠ Budget extra: `tests/test_utils.py` currently **asserts the buggy
   behaviour** — `test_unknown_family` expects `wizardlm2:7b → "unknown"` and
   `test_float_size` expects `solar:10.7b → family "unknown"`. Both must be
   rewritten as part of the fix, or the suite will fail on a correct
   implementation.
2. **D10 regime split** — classify records, emit `regime_split.csv`, and find
   out whether a usable single-shot cohort exists. Do this early: the answer
   determines whether D6 keeps its GPU probe and whether Finding 1 can be
   rewritten with a real first-attempt number. ~2 hours, no inference.
3. **D2 decisive test** — split direction accuracy by side-to-move. If a
   perspective bug exists, this reveals it immediately and changes what D1
   needs to say. Do not proceed to D1 write-up before this resolves. ~1 hour.
4. **D1** — compute class priors and κ, emit `direction_baselines.csv`, then
   rewrite Finding 3 against whatever the numbers actually show. ~2 hours.
5. **D4** — propagate corrected metrics into H3/H4 and the family table. ~1 hour.
6. **D5** — blunder rate, bootstrap CIs, `cpl_buckets.csv`. ~2 hours.
7. **D6** — relabel legality as harness-assisted; fold in the D10 regime split.
   Strike step 3's probe if D10 step 4 delivered adequate coverage. ~1 hour.
8. **D9 documentation pass** — provenance block, then correct the engine and
   depth claims across all five documents. ~1–2 hours.
9. **D11** — delete the stale `learning_deltas.csv`, make the empty-frame path
   remove it, reconcile `.gitignore` against the git index. ~30 minutes.
10. **D7/D8** — remaining provenance and doc-drift cleanup not already absorbed
    by D9. ~30 minutes.
11. Rewrite `docs/FINDINGS.md` Findings 1/3/5 and the Summary Table.
    Restructure to lead with the bimodal CPL result.
12. Full `pytest` run; commit; push.

## Edge cases

- **Positions where Stockfish eval is mate-encoded** (7% of records) — must be
  excluded from Spearman ρ, or the ±16,000 values dominate the rank
  correlation. Reuse the `MATE_SCORE_THRESHOLD_CP = 9000` constant.
- **Models with missing records** — deepseek-r1:7b is short ~1,030 of 24,000
  (~4.3%). Bootstrap CIs must resample within model, not across.
- **κ undefined** when a model emits a single class for every position;
  return `NaN` explicitly and surface it rather than coercing to 0.
- **MoE parameter counts** — `mixtral:8x7b` has 56B total / ~12.9B active.
  Excluded from scaling regressions; flagged, not silently assigned one number.
- **gemma4:e2b / e4b** are "effective parameter" variants; their real memory
  footprint differs from dense models of the same nominal size. Document in the
  scaling section rather than plotting them on the same axis.
- **Ties in `rank_tied`** — CIs overlapping pairwise is not transitive; report
  as a set of statistically indistinguishable models, not a chain.
- **Rerunning the family aggregation** must not silently drop a model — assert
  output group count equals distinct model count (22).
- **`qwen2.5:72b`** is commented out in `config.yaml` (OOM at 32GB RAM/16GB
  VRAM) but listed as pulled in `docs/CHANGES.md`. Reconcile the docs; it is
  not in the 22.
- **Records with no `timestamp`** (D10) — classify as `unknown` regime and
  report the count; never silently assign them to a side of the cutover.
- **Records straddling the cutover within one model/tier** (D10) — the pipeline
  processed one model at a time, so most models sit wholly on one side. Expect
  a small number of models split mid-run; report their split rather than
  assigning the model to a regime.
- **A pre-rescue cohort that covers only some models** (D10 step 4) — report
  single-shot legality only for covered models, and state explicitly which
  models have no single-shot figure. Do not average across an unbalanced set
  and present it as an all-model rate.
- **`enrich_cpl.py` ran after the cutover** (D10) — CPL enrichment is
  regime-independent (it re-evaluates stored legal moves post hoc), so the
  clamped-CPL and WP-loss results are unaffected by the split. Only legality
  and the meaning of a null `t2_move` are regime-dependent. State this, so a
  reader does not assume D10 contaminates the bimodal result.
- **Deleting `learning_deltas.csv`** (D11) — it is tracked in git despite the
  `.gitignore` entry, so removal needs `git rm`, not just an `rm`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11+, `pandas`, `numpy` (already in `requirements.txt`)
- **`scipy`** — new. Needed for `scipy.stats.spearmanr` and bootstrap CIs.
  Add to `requirements.txt`.
- `sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score` and `balanced_accuracy_score`, **or** a
  hand-rolled κ (~15 lines) to avoid a large new dependency. Prefer
  hand-rolled; it is trivial and keeps the dependency surface small.
- `results/evaluations.jsonl` — **local to the Linux PC only, not in git.**
  All of this work must happen there.
- D6 step 3 (single-shot probe) additionally needs Ollama + all 22 models
  resident, and ~13,200 inference calls.

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `pytest` green, including all new tests in `tests/test_metric_defects.py`.
2. No shipped CSV contains a pre-audit metric column without a `_legacy` suffix.
3. `by_model_family.csv` has exactly 22 rows, one per model, none `unknown`,
   none size 0.
4. `summary.json` carries `generated_at`, git SHA, engine versions, config
   snapshot.
5. `direction_baselines.csv` exists; Finding 3 quotes the majority-class
   baseline and κ, not the 33% figure.
6. Every number in `docs/FINDINGS.md` is traceable to a CSV or `summary.json`
   key — none hand-typed.
7. The D2 side-to-move split is resolved and its outcome documented, whichever
   way it lands.
8. No shipped `.md` claims "Stockfish 17" or "depth 22"; every document names
   the engine that actually produced the numbers, with its search budget and
   the GPU-throughput rationale.
9. `summary.json` carries a `provenance` block naming the T1 and T2 engines,
   and flagging `stockfish_*` as legacy field names holding Lc0 values.
10. `regime_split.csv` exists; no document reports a pooled legality figure
    across the pre/post-rescue boundary.
11. The D10 single-shot question is resolved either way — a gated single-shot
    number with per-model `n`, or an explicit statement that the pre-rescue
    cohort is too thin, with D6's probe rescoped accordingly.
12. `results/metrics/learning_deltas.csv` no longer exists, and a correction-free
    regeneration removes it rather than leaving it stale.
13. `.gitignore` and the git index agree on whether `results/metrics/` is
    committed output.

## Note on scope

D1–D11 are metric-construction, provenance, and propagation defects. **No fix
in this register requires re-running the benchmark.** Every item is
postprocessing over `results/evaluations.jsonl`, a documentation correction, or
file housekeeping. Do not re-collect data for any of them.

The data collection itself — 526,662 records at 99.75% of planned coverage, no
duplicate `(model, position_id, prompt_format)` keys, seeded and stratified
sampling — is sound. The one qualification D10 adds is that it was not
collected under a *single code version*: the worker's rescue logic landed
mid-run. That is a defect in how the results are described, not in the results
themselves, and it is fully characterisable from the stored `timestamp` field.
It is also an opportunity — the pre-rescue cohort is genuine single-shot data,
which is the number D6 assumed had to be bought with GPU time.

The **bimodal move-quality result** (17.8% near-perfect, 39.1% catastrophic,
flat across 2B→70B) is the study's real contribution and is the finding least
disturbed by these fixes — including D9 and D10, since CPL enrichment is
regime-independent and its engine (Lc0 @ 800 nodes) was always correctly
documented. The restructured writeup should lead with it.

## Appendix — smaller items found in the same 2026-08-13 read

Not triaged into the register. Recorded so they are not rediscovered later.

| # | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A | Plots still use the legacy `t1_direction_correct_mean` (±50 cp) **and draw the invalid "Chance (33%)" reference line** — D1 is baked into the committed charts, not just the CSVs. D4 lists H3/H4/family-agg but omits the plotting layer. | `scripts/generate_plots.py:153, 229` |
| B | `by_source.csv` is single-valued — every row is `lichess_puzzles`. The three-source design (Lichess / real-game / generated), `aggregate_by_source`, the "Source Comparison" plot and detailed-spec acceptance criterion are all vestigial. `dataset_builder.py` still carries the unused PGN and generated code paths. | `results/metrics/by_source.csv`, `src/dataset_builder.py` |
| C | `phase` is a pure material heuristic, not real game phase: `_validate_puzzle_row` calls `determine_phase(board, 20)` with a hardcoded move count, since puzzle rows have no PGN. Distribution per model is ~5.7% opening / 25% endgame / 69% middlegame — so **H5, the one supported hypothesis, rests on 1,368 rows per model** labelled by piece count alone. | `src/dataset_builder.py:62`, `results/metrics/by_phase.csv` |
| D | `flask` is missing from `requirements.txt` despite `dashboard/server.py` requiring it. `scipy` will also be needed for D1/D5. | `requirements.txt` |
| E | `docs/SCRIPTS.md` documents four Lc0 scripts (`precompute_lc0.py`, `_batch.py`, `_fast.py`) of which only `precompute_lc0_batch_v2.py` exists, and mislabels T3 as "move quality". | `docs/SCRIPTS.md` |
| F | `docs/RESEARCH.md` is badly stale: "5.8M positions across 19 models" (actual: 4,000 × 22), and its central anti-contamination argument to judges is *"the correction loop is your best defense"* — infrastructure that produced no data. This is the document framing the YSTE submission. | `docs/RESEARCH.md` |
| G | All `bin/*.sh` hardcode `/home/rabrew/Desktop/chess-llm-bench`; `specs/dashboard.md` references a different absolute path (`/mnt/shared/...`). Violates the "no hardcoded paths" rule in `CLAUDE.md`. | `bin/*.sh` |
| H | `test_parse_response_formats.py` defines `test_gemma3_12b` twice in one class — the second silently shadows the first. Its "All 19 models" section also predates the 22-model set and omits gemma4, codellama, yi, command-r, mixtral. | `tests/test_parse_response_formats.py:1231, 1293` |
